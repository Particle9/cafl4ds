"""The regime stream — the P1.0.2 deployment diet's attribute-driven era ordering.

Where :class:`~cafl4ds.data.streams.EraStream` orders a *single* class axis into eras (and labels its
eval sets on that same axis), the deployment diet needs the two-axis structure an
:class:`~cafl4ds.data.attributes.AttributeSource` provides: it orders **eras on the era-key axis**
(the driving regime) while reserving its held-out probe set on the **orthogonal canary axis** (so the
labelled canary reads something the diet did not sort by). It is otherwise a faithful sibling of
``EraStream`` — single-pass, a batch is never split across eras, and ``block_size`` is the same
correlation-strength knob — so it drops straight into the Phase-1 harness's ``run_stream_arm``.

Kept in its own module (importing only the stable :class:`~cafl4ds.data.streams.StreamBatch` /
:class:`~cafl4ds.data.streams.EvalSet` / :class:`~cafl4ds.data.streams.EvalSets` dataclasses) so the
Phase-0 stream is untouched.

            regime_order: Explicit regime walk order; defaults to the source's shift-walk order.
            block_size: Correlation knob — ``None`` delivers each regime contiguously (maximal

                after each regime, the same global probe support is scored on the current and all

                least one available image remains for training. ``0`` preserves the deployment-only
                reservation.
            max_train_per_regime: If set, cap the training images per regime (bounds run length).
            drop_last: Whether to drop the final short batch.
            seed: RNG seed for the **within-regime shuffle** (frame order inside each era, and — with
                ``max_train_per_regime`` — which frames survive). Varies per drive across a seed
                ensemble; does **not** touch the held-out reservation (see ``canary_seed``).
            canary_seed: RNG seed for the **held-out canary reservation** — which support/query
                frames each scene sets aside. Deliberately *decoupled* from ``seed`` and fixed by
                default, so every drive in a seed ensemble (and the warm well, which reserves the
